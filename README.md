# event-sourcing-pt2

This is a simple repository that illustrates how to implement event sourcing in Typescript using minimal dependencies:

* `pg` as the postgres client;
* Node's [test runner](https://nodejs.org/api/test.html)
* [ts-pattern](https://github.com/gvergnaud/ts-pattern) for pattern matching.
